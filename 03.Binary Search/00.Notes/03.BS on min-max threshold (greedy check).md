### ‚úÖ Approach 1: Binary Search on Eating Speed

**Explanation**  
We are given piles of bananas, and Koko can eat at most `k` bananas per hour. We need to find the **minimum value of k** such that she finishes all bananas within `h` hours.

**Steps**
1. Define the range of speeds: `low = 1` to `high = max(piles)`.
2. For each `mid` (possible speed), calculate total hours required using helper function.
3. If total hours `<= h`, it's a valid speed ‚Äî try lower speed (`high = mid`).
4. Otherwise, increase the speed (`low = mid + 1`).
5. Return `low` ‚Äî the smallest valid speed.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * log m), where `n` = number of piles and `m` = max pile size  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Code**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  
    int totalHR(vector<int>& piles, int perHR) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int i : piles) {
            total += ceil((double)i / perHR);
        }
        return total;
    }

    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = *max_element(piles.begin(), piles.end());

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int totalHr = totalHR(piles, mid);
            if (totalHr <= h) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }
};
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets

---

### ‚úÖ Approach 1: Binary Search on Days

**Explanation**  
We need to find the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets, each needing `k` consecutive bloomed flowers.

**Steps**
1. Check edge case: if `m * k > n`, return -1.
2. Binary search on days from `min(bloomDay)` to `max(bloomDay)`.
3. Use a helper to check how many bouquets can be made on day `mid`.
4. If enough bouquets (`>= m`), store `mid` and search for smaller day.
5. Else increase day.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * log(max - min))  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Code**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(vector<int>& bloomDay, int k, int day) {
        int bouquets = 0;
        int flowers = 0;

        for (int bloom : bloomDay) {
            if (bloom <= day) {
                flowers++;
            } else {
                flowers = 0;
            }

            if (flowers == k) {
                bouquets++;
                flowers = 0;
            }
        }

        return bouquets;
    }

    int minDays(vector<int>& bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        if ((long long)m * k > bloomDay.size())
            return -1;

        int left = *min_element(bloomDay.begin(), bloomDay.end());
        int right = *max_element(bloomDay.begin(), bloomDay.end());
        int ans = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int bouquets = solve(bloomDay, k, mid);

            if (bouquets >= m) {
                ans = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold  
üîó [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-smallest-divisor-given-a-threshold)

---

### ‚úÖ Approach 1: Binary Search on Divisor

**Explanation**  
We must find the smallest divisor such that the sum of all divisions (ceiling) of elements is ‚â§ threshold.

**Steps**
1. Define range of divisors: from `1` to `max(nums)`.
2. For each `mid`, calculate the total sum using `(num + mid - 1) / mid`.
3. If total ‚â§ threshold, update `ans` and reduce search.
4. Else increase `mid`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * log m), m = max(nums)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Code**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(vector<int>& nums, int mid) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            ans += (i + mid - 1) / mid;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    int smallestDivisor(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int ans = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int temp = solve(nums, mid);

            if (temp <= threshold) {
                ans = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days  
üîó [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days)

---

### ‚úÖ Approach 1: Binary Search on Ship Capacity

**Explanation**  
We want to find the minimum ship capacity to deliver all packages within `D` days.

**Steps**
1. Define range: `left = max(weights)`, `right = sum(weights)`.
2. For each `mid`, simulate shipping:
   - Accumulate weight for current day.
   - If over capacity, increment day count.
3. If days needed ‚â§ D, try smaller capacity.
4. Else increase capacity.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * log(sum - max))  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Code**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int helper(vector<int>& weights, int capacity) {
        int temp = 0;
        int day = 1;

        for (int wt : weights) {
            if (temp + wt > capacity) {
                temp = 0;
                day++;
            }
            temp += wt;
        }
        return day;
    }

    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int days) {
        int left = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        int right = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);
        int ans = INT_MAX;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            int requiredDays = helper(weights, mid);

            if (requiredDays <= days) {
                ans = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
