I want detailed raw markdown notes for a specific DSA pattern.

## üß† PATTERN: **<PATTERN NAME>**

---

### ‚úÖ List of Problems

Please provide the list of problems in **bullet list format** using Markdown, where each problem name is a **clickable link** to the problem. Example:

- [Problem Name](problem_link)

---

### üìù Notes Format for Each Problem

After listing the problems, write detailed notes for **each problem** in the same order as listed. Follow the structure below for **each approach** in every problem:

```
approach <number>
explanation
steps
TC SC
code
```

**Notes Requirements:**

- Give all notes in **raw markdown format** (unrendered).
- All code blocks must be enclosed in **triple backticks (```)**.
- Each problem's notes should start after the list with its heading as:

  ```
  ## 1) Problem Name
  üîó [Problem Link](actual_link_here)
  ```

- Each approach inside the problem should follow the mentioned format (approach-wise breakdown).
- If multiple approaches are there, mention in increasing order of efficiency.
- Use **only the code provided in the context** (don't write your own) and **separate each approach's code properly**.
- Maintain the **class and function** structure in code as given in the context.
- Do not mix explanations or code of different approaches.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Do not render the markdown.
- Do not summarize or skip approaches.
- Give walkthrough-like detailed steps for each approach.
- The output must be 100% markdown compliant and structured for clean copy-paste into a markdown file or editor.
