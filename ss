âœ… 1. Implementation Problems (Basic Data Structure Design)
These focus on designing the data structure using arrays, linked lists, or other DS:

ðŸ”¹ Stack and Queue Implementations
Implement Stack using Arrays

Implement Queue using Arrays

Implement Stack using Queue

Implement Queue using Stack

Implement Stack using Linked List

Implement Queue using Linked List

Implement Min Stack â€“ Special stack with getMin() in O(1)

âœ… 2. Stack-Based Expression Conversion / Evaluation
These problems revolve around converting or evaluating expressions, using stacks to hold operators and operands:

ðŸ”¹ Expression Conversion & Evaluation
Check for balanced parentheses

Infix to Postfix Conversion using Stack

Convert Infix to Prefix Notation

Prefix to Infix Conversion

Prefix to Postfix Conversion 

Postfix to Prefix Conversion

Postfix to Infix Conversion

Core Pattern: Stack used for operator precedence & evaluation logic

âœ… 3. Monotonic Stack Pattern
Used for problems involving next greater/smaller element, histogram problems, ranges, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Next Greater/Smaller Element Variants
Next Greater Element

Next Greater Element II

Next Smaller Element

Number of NGEs to the Right

ðŸ”¹ Histogram and Range-Based
Largest Rectangle in a Histogram

Maximal Rectangle (2D extension of histogram problem)

Sum of Subarray Minimums

Sum of Subarray Ranges

âœ… 4. Stack + Simulation Problems
Simulating real-world behavior (e.g., physical systems, digit removal, collisions):

Asteroid Collision â€“ Stack simulates collision and direction

Remove K Digits â€“ Greedy + Monotonic Stack

âœ… 5. Sliding Window / Deque Problems
These use a deque (double-ended queue) or heap/priority queue to maintain a window of max/min:

Sliding Window Maximum

Stock Span Problem â€“ Can be solved using monotonic stack

Trapping Rain Water â€“ Two pointer or stack approach

âœ… 6. Matrix Based / Grid Simulation
These usually involve 2D traversal with stack or DP concepts:

Maximal Rectangle â€“ Based on Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Trapping Rain Water â€“ 1D/2D extension using stack or two pointers

âœ… 7. Advanced Stack/Cache Simulation
These involve designing a caching system with O(1) operations, often using HashMaps + DLL:

LRU Cache (IMPORTANT) â€“ Least Recently Used; O(1) using HashMap + Doubly Linked List

LFU Cache â€“ Least Frequently Used; Requires O(1) or close using advanced DS

âœ… 8. Graph / Matrix / Logical Deduction
These problems require deductive logic, not just DS:

The Celebrity Problem â€“ Matrix + Deduction or Stack
