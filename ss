# 📘 Grouped Linked List Questions Based on Patterns & Approaches

---

## 🧱 1. **Basics of Linked List Operations (Singly and Doubly)**

> Fundamental operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and structure.

- Introduction to LinkedList, learn about struct, and how is node represented  
- Inserting a node in LinkedList  
- Deleting a node in LinkedList  
- Find the length of the linkedlist [learn traversal]  
- Search an element in the LL  
- Introduction to DLL, learn about struct, and how is node represented  
- Insert a node in DLL  
- Delete a node in DLL  
- Delete all occurrences of a key in DLL  
- Remove duplicates from sorted DLL

## 🔁 2. **Linked List Reversal Patterns**

> Focused on reversal using iterative, recursive, or in groups.

- Reverse a LinkedList [Iterative]  
- Reverse a LL [Recursive]  
- Reverse a DLL  
- Reverse LL in group of given size K

## 🧭 3. **Tortoise-Hare / Two Pointer Techniques**

> Used for detecting loops, middle nodes, and palindrome checking.

- Middle of a LinkedList [Tortoise-Hare Method]  
- Detect a loop in LL  
- Find starting point in LL  
- Length of Loop in LL  
- Check if LL is palindrome or not  
- Remove Nth node from the back of the LL  
- Delete the middle node of LL

## 🧮 4. **Mathematical / Number Simulation on LL**

> LL represents numbers and we perform addition or increment operations.

- Add 1 to a number represented by LL  
- Add 2 numbers in LL  

---

## 🔄 5. **Link Rearrangement / Segregation**

> Manipulating node links to rearrange or sort the list.

- Segrregate odd and even nodes in LL  
- Sort LL  
- Sort a LL of 0's 1's and 2's by changing links  
- Rotate a LL

## 🔗 6. **Multiple Pointer or Structure LL**

> Linked Lists with extra pointers like `random`, or hierarchical structures.

- Flattening of LL  
- Clone a Linked List with random and next pointer  

---

## 🎯 7. **Y Shaped / Merging / Intersection Based**

> Focused on intersection point or pair-based logic.

- Find intersection point of Y LL  
- Find pairs with given sum in DLL
