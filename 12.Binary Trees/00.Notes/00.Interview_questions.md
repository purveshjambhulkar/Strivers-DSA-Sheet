## Question: Explain Trees in Data Structures — Definition, Components, Operations, Types, and Pros & Cons

A **tree** is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains data and references to its child nodes. It has one special node called the **root** (with no parent) and **leaf nodes** (with no children).

### Components of a Tree:
- **Root:** The topmost node, with no parent.
- **Node:** A basic unit containing a value and references to its children.
- **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.
- **Leaf:** A node with no children.
- **Internal Node:** A node with at least one child.
- **Subtree:** A tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.

### Basic Operations:
- **Insertion:** Add a new node while maintaining tree properties.
- **Deletion:** Remove a node while preserving structure.
- **Traversal:** Visit each node in a specific order (preorder, inorder, postorder).
- **Searching:** Find a node with a given value based on search criteria.

### Types of Trees:
- **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children.
- **Full Binary Tree:** Every node except leaves has exactly two children.
- **Complete Binary Tree:** All levels are filled except possibly the last, filled left to right.
- **Perfect Binary Tree:** All internal nodes have two children, and all leaves are at the same level.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Left subtree values < root < right subtree values.
- **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing BST with height difference ≤ 1 between subtrees.
- **Red-Black Tree:** Self-balancing BST with specific coloring rules to maintain balance.
- **B-Tree:** Generalized search tree with more than two children per node.

### Advantages:
- Efficient representation and organization of hierarchical data.
- Fast searching and traversal in balanced trees.

### Disadvantages:
- Memory overhead due to storing pointers or references.
- Less efficient for large unstructured datasets.

## Difference Between Binary Tree (BT) and Binary Search Tree (BST)

| Aspect              | Binary Tree (BT)                                                                 | Binary Search Tree (BST)                                                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | A tree where each node has at most two children (left and right).                | A binary tree where left subtree values are less than root, and right subtree values are greater. |
| **Ordering**        | No specific ordering of nodes is required.                                       | Follows strict ordering property for all nodes.                                   |
| **Structure**       | Can be any shape (not necessarily balanced or ordered).                          | Can be balanced or unbalanced but must maintain BST property.                     |
| **Searching**       | Search time is `O(n)` in worst case (no ordering to help).                        | Average search time is `O(log n)` for balanced BST, worst `O(n)` for skewed tree.  |
| **Insertion**       | Insert anywhere without order restriction.                                        | Must insert in correct position to maintain BST property.                          |
| **Use Cases**       | General-purpose tree representation, hierarchical data storage.                   | Efficient searching, sorting, and range queries.                                  |

## Difference Between Full Binary Tree, Complete Binary Tree, and Perfect Binary Tree

| Aspect                  | Full Binary Tree                                                                                   | Complete Binary Tree                                                                                       | Perfect Binary Tree                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Every node has either 0 or 2 children (no node has exactly 1 child).                              | All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.             | All internal nodes have exactly 2 children and all leaves are at the same level.                                   |
| **Node Children**       | 0 or 2 children only.                                                                              | Can have 1 or 2 children, but filling follows left-to-right order.                                         | Always exactly 2 children for non-leaf nodes.                                                                       |
| **Level Filling**       | Not necessarily completely filled at all levels.                                                   | Almost full — only the last level may be incomplete, filled left to right.                                 | Completely filled at all levels.                                                                                    |
| **Height Balance**      | Not necessarily balanced.                                                                          | More balanced than a general binary tree but not necessarily perfectly balanced.                           | Perfectly balanced — all leaves are at same depth.                                                                  |
| **Example Structure**   | Can have missing nodes on last level but each parent has 0 or 2 children.                          | Last level partially filled, but nodes appear in left-to-right order.                                      | Every possible node position is filled.                                                                             |
| **Use Cases**           | Expression trees, decision trees.                                                                  | Heap implementations (Min-Heap, Max-Heap).                                                                 | Networking trees, tournament brackets.                                                                              |
