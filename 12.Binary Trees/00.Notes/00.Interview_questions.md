## Question: Explain Trees in Data Structures — Definition, Components, Operations, Types, and Pros & Cons

A **tree** is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains data and references to its child nodes. It has one special node called the **root** (with no parent) and **leaf nodes** (with no children).

### Components of a Tree:
- **Root:** The topmost node, with no parent.
- **Node:** A basic unit containing a value and references to its children.
- **Edge:** A connection between two nodes.
- **Leaf:** A node with no children.
- **Internal Node:** A node with at least one child.
- **Subtree:** A tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.

### Basic Operations:
- **Insertion:** Add a new node while maintaining tree properties.
- **Deletion:** Remove a node while preserving structure.
- **Traversal:** Visit each node in a specific order (preorder, inorder, postorder).
- **Searching:** Find a node with a given value based on search criteria.

### Types of Trees:
- **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children.
- **Full Binary Tree:** Every node except leaves has exactly two children.
- **Complete Binary Tree:** All levels are filled except possibly the last, filled left to right.
- **Perfect Binary Tree:** All internal nodes have two children, and all leaves are at the same level.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Left subtree values < root < right subtree values.
- **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing BST with height difference ≤ 1 between subtrees.
- **Red-Black Tree:** Self-balancing BST with specific coloring rules to maintain balance.
- **B-Tree:** Generalized search tree with more than two children per node.

### Advantages:
- Efficient representation and organization of hierarchical data.
- Fast searching and traversal in balanced trees.

### Disadvantages:
- Memory overhead due to storing pointers or references.
- Less efficient for large unstructured datasets.
