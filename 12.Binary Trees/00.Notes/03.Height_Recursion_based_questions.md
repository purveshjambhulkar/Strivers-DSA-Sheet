# Height of a Binary Tree

## ðŸ“˜ Definition

- The **height** of a binary tree is the **number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf node**.
- Alternatively, it can be defined as:
  - Height of an empty tree: `-1`
  - Height of a tree with a single node (only root): `0`
  - Height = `max(height of left subtree, height of right subtree) + 1`

> ðŸ“Œ Some books define the height in terms of number of nodes instead of edges. Be clear on which definition is being used.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Observations

- **Leaf nodes** have height 0 (no edges below them).
- A tree with only left or only right children will have height equal to the number of nodes - 1.
- Height is used in many tree-based problems like:
  - Diameter of tree
  - Balanced binary tree check
  - AVL tree rotations



## PROBLEMS BASED ON HEIGHT OF BT

## 01) Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

# Approach 1 - Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Key Observations

- The depth of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
- For any node, the maximum depth is `1 + max(left subtree depth, right subtree depth)`.
- A recursive approach is naturally suited for this problem since each subtree can be considered a smaller instance of the same problem.

## Steps

1. If the current node (`root`) is `NULL`, return `0` because it doesn't contribute to the depth.
2. Recursively calculate the depth of the left subtree.
3. Recursively calculate the depth of the right subtree.
4. Return `1 + max(left, right)` to account for the current node.

## Example Walkthrough

Given the binary tree:

```
      3
     / \
    9  20
       / \
      15  7
```

- Starting at node `3`, recursively check both left and right.
- Left child `9` has no children â†’ depth is 1.
- Right child `20` has children `15` and `7` â†’ depth is 2.
- So, depth at node `3` is `1 + max(1, 2) = 3`.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.

## Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL) {
            return 0;
        }

        return 1 + max(maxDepth(root->left), maxDepth(root->right));
    }
};
```

## 02) Balanced Binary Tree

# Approach 1 - Top-down Recursive Check

## Key Observations

- A binary tree is **balanced** if the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by no more than 1 for **every** node.
- A simple recursive approach would check:
  1. If left and right subtrees are balanced.
  2. If the height difference at the current node is â‰¤ 1.
- This approach recomputes heights multiple times for the same subtrees, leading to inefficiency.

## Steps

1. Define a helper function `height()` that computes the height of a subtree recursively.
2. In the main function `isBalanced()`, for the current node:
   - Recursively check if the left subtree is balanced.
   - Recursively check if the right subtree is balanced.
   - Check if the absolute height difference between left and right is â‰¤ 1.
3. If all three conditions are true, return true. Otherwise, return false.

## Example Walkthrough

Given the tree:
```
      1
     / \
    2   2
   / \
  3   3
 / \
4   4
```

- At root (1), left subtree height is 3, right subtree height is 1 â†’ difference is 2 â†’ Not balanced.
- Function returns false.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` in the worst case.
  - For each node, `height()` may be called recursively, leading to repeated work.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree due to the call stack.

> Note: This solution can be optimized by combining the balance check and height computation in a single recursive traversal.

## Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int height(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL) {
            return 0;
        }

        return 1 + max(height(root->left), height(root->right));
    }

    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL) {
            return true;
        }

        bool l = isBalanced(root->left);
        bool r = isBalanced(root->right);

        bool diff = abs(height(root->left) - height(root->right)) <= 1;

        if (l && r && diff) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```

## 03) Diameter of Binary Tree

# Approach 1 - Recursive Postorder Traversal to Compute Diameter

## Key Observations

- The **diameter** of a binary tree is defined as the length (number of edges) of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
- This path may or may not pass through the root.
- The longest path through a node is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees.
- A postorder traversal (left, right, root) is suitable because we must compute subtree heights before checking the diameter at the current node.

## Steps

1. Create a helper function `diameterUtil` that:
   - Returns the height of the subtree rooted at the current node.
   - Updates the reference `diameter` if the current node's left+right height exceeds the current maximum.
2. Start recursion from the root and track the maximum diameter found.
3. The final result is the `diameter` after the traversal completes.

## Example Walkthrough

Given the binary tree:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \     
    4   5    
```

- Longest path: 4 â†’ 2 â†’ 1 â†’ 3 (length = 3 edges).
- The helper function computes heights recursively and updates `diameter` with `left_height + right_height` at each node.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
  - Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(h)`  
  - Due to recursion stack, where `h` is the height of the tree.

## Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int diameterUtil(TreeNode* root , int& diameter){
        if(root == NULL){
            return 0;
        }

        int lh = diameterUtil(root->left , diameter);
        int rh = diameterUtil(root->right , diameter);

        diameter = max(diameter , lh + rh);

        return 1 + max(lh , rh);
    }

    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int diameter = 0 ;
        diameterUtil(root , diameter);
        return diameter;
    }
};
```

## 04) Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

# Approach 1 - Recursive DFS with Global Maximum

## Key Observations

- The *maximum path sum* in a binary tree is the **maximum sum over any path** that can start and end at any node in the tree.
- A path can pass through the root or skip the root, and must go downward only from parent to child in terms of traversal direction (not necessarily to leaf).
- The maximum path at each node can be either:
  - Node value alone
  - Node + left subtree
  - Node + right subtree
  - Node + left + right (forms a "V" shape)
- To avoid negative path sums reducing the total, we only consider **positive contributions** from subtrees.

## Steps

1. Define a helper function `maxPathUtil` that returns the max path sum rooted at a given node and updates a reference `maxi` for the global max.
2. For each node:
   - Recursively calculate left and right max path sums.
   - If any of them are negative, treat them as 0.
   - Update the global `maxi` with `node->val + left + right`.
   - Return `node->val + max(left, right)` for continued path.
3. In `maxPathSum`, initialize `maxi` as `INT_MIN` and invoke the utility function.

## Example Walkthrough

For this tree:

```
        -10
        /  \
       9   20
           / \
          15  7
```

- At node 15 and 7, max path = their values.
- At node 20, path sum = 20 + 15 + 7 = 42
- At node -10, path sum = max of left (9), right (42), etc.
- Final max = 42

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack (O(log N) for balanced tree, O(N) for skewed).

## Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathUtil(TreeNode*& root, int& maxi) {
        if (root == NULL) {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = max(0, maxPathUtil(root->left, maxi));
        int right = max(0, maxPathUtil(root->right, maxi));

        maxi = max(maxi, (root->val + left + right));

        return root->val + max(left, right);
    }

    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxi = INT_MIN;
        maxPathUtil(root, maxi);
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

## 04) Same Tree

# Approach 1 - Recursive Tree Comparison

## Key Observations

- Two binary trees are considered *identical* if they are structurally the same and the nodes have the same value.
- Recursively checking each corresponding node in both trees is an intuitive approach.
- Base conditions help us quickly identify mismatch or null trees.
- If both nodes are `NULL`, they are considered the same.
- If one is `NULL` and the other is not, or if their values don't match, the trees are different.

## Steps

1. Check the base case:
   - If both nodes are `NULL`, return `true`.
   - If one is `NULL` and the other is not, return `false`.
2. If the values of the current nodes do not match, return `false`.
3. Recursively check the left subtree and the right subtree.
4. Return `true` only if:
   - Left subtrees are identical,
   - Right subtrees are identical,
   - Current nodes have equal values.

## Example Walkthrough

Given:

Tree `p`:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

Tree `q`:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

- Compare root nodes: both are 1 â†’ OK.
- Compare left children: both are 2 â†’ OK.
- Compare right children: both are 3 â†’ OK.
- All checks return true â†’ Trees are identical.

Now consider:

Tree `q`:
```
    1
   / \
  2   4
```

- Root: 1 â†’ OK.
- Left: 2 â†’ OK.
- Right: 3 (in `p`) vs 4 (in `q`) â†’ Not equal â†’ return false.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the smaller tree (or both if they are equal), since each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to recursion stack. O(log N) for balanced, O(N) for skewed.

## Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left),
 * right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {

        // //Approach 1
        // if ((p != NULL && q == NULL) || (p == NULL && q != NULL)){
        //     return false;
        // }
        // if(p == NULL && q == NULL){
        //     return true;
        // }

        // bool left = isSameTree(p->left , q->left);
        // bool right = isSameTree(p->right , q->right);

        // bool val = p->val == q->val;

        // if(left && right && val){
        //     return true;
        // }else{
        //     return false;
        // }

        // Same approach but shorter code

        if (p == NULL || q == NULL) {
            return p == q;
        } else
            return (p->val == q->val) && isSameTree(p->left, q->left) &&
                   isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
    }
};
```
