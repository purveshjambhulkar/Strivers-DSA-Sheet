# 📘 Binary Tree – Complete Notes

## ✅ Introduction

A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical **non-linear data structure** where each node has **at most two children**:

- **Left Child**
- **Right Child**

> The topmost node is called the **Root**, and nodes with no children are called **Leaves**.

## 🧱 Structure of a Binary Tree Node

Each node typically consists of:

- **Data**: The actual value stored.
- **Left pointer**: Points to the left child.
- **Right pointer**: Points to the right child.

### C++ Representation

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = nullptr;
    }
};

## 🧠 Properties of Binary Tree

| Property                              | Value                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maximum number of nodes at level `l`  | `2^l`                                                       |
| Maximum nodes in a tree of height `h` | `2^(h+1) - 1`                                               |
| Minimum height with `n` nodes         | `ceil(log₂(n+1)) - 1`                                       |
| Number of leaf nodes `L`              | `L = N - I` (where `N` = total nodes, `I` = internal nodes) |

## 🏗️ Types of Binary Trees

### 1. **Full Binary Tree**

Every node has either 0 or 2 children.

### 2. **Complete Binary Tree**

All levels are completely filled except the last level, and nodes are as far left as possible.

### 3. **Perfect Binary Tree**

All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

### 4. **Balanced Binary Tree**

The height difference between left and right subtrees for any node is not more than 1.

### 5. **Degenerate (Skewed) Tree**

Each parent has only one child. Can be left or right-skewed.

## 🧮 Time & Space Complexities

| Operation                           | Time Complexity       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, etc.) | O(N)                  |
| Insert/Search (Unbalanced)          | O(N)                  |
| Insert/Search (Balanced)            | O(log N)              |
| Space (Auxiliary for recursion)     | O(H) where H = height |

# 🌲 Properties of Binary Trees

Understanding binary tree properties helps derive bounds on size, height, leaf count, and structure. Below are the key theoretical properties:

---

## 📌 1. **Maximum Nodes at Level `l`**

> At **level `l`**, a binary tree can have at most **2^l** nodes.

- **Level Definition**: Number of edges from root to node (root is at level 0).

### ✅ Proof by Induction:
- **Base Case**: For level `l = 0`, nodes = 2⁰ = 1 ✅
- **Inductive Step**: If level `l` has `2^l` nodes, then level `l+1` can have `2 × 2^l = 2^(l+1)` nodes.

---

## 📌 2. **Maximum Nodes in a Binary Tree of Height `h`**

> A binary tree of height `h` can have **at most 2^(h+1) - 1 nodes**.

- **Height Definition**: Longest path from root to leaf.
  - Tree with 1 root node → height = 0
  - Empty tree → height = -1

### ✅ Formula Derivation:
```text
Total nodes = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^h = 2^(h+1) - 1
```

> Some books define height differently:
- If root-only tree = height 1 → formula = `2^h - 1`

---

## 📌 3. **Minimum Height for N Nodes**

> The **minimum possible height** `h` for `N` nodes is:  
**h ≥ ⌊log₂N⌋**

### ✅ Explanation:
- A binary tree of height `h` can have at most: `2^(h+1) - 1` nodes
- Rearranging:
```text
N ≤ 2^(h+1) - 1  
⇒ 2^(h+1) ≥ N + 1  
⇒ h + 1 ≥ log₂(N + 1)  
⇒ h ≥ log₂(N + 1) - 1  
⇒ h ≥ ⌊log₂N⌋
```

---

## 📌 4. **Minimum Levels for `L` Leaves**

> A binary tree with `L` leaves must have at least **⌊log₂L⌋ levels**

### ✅ Why?
- Max leaves at a level = `2^l` → solving `L ≤ 2^l`:
```text
l ≥ log₂L  
⇒ l_min = ⌊log₂L⌋
```

---

## 📌 5. **Nodes with Two Children vs Leaf Nodes**

> In a **Full Binary Tree**:
**Number of leaf nodes (L)** = **Internal nodes with 2 children (T) + 1**

### ✅ Formula:
```text
L = T + 1
```

### ✅ Proof:
- Total nodes = `2^(h+1) - 1`
- Leaf nodes = `2^h`
- Internal nodes (T) = total - leaf = `2^h - 1`
- So, `L = 2^h = T + 1`

---

## 📌 6. **Total Edges in a Binary Tree**

> In a binary tree with `n` nodes:
```text
Total Edges = n - 1
```

### ✅ Reason:
- Each node except root has exactly **1 parent**.
- So `n - 1` parent-child connections = `n - 1` edges.

## 📌 Summary Table

| Property | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Max nodes at level `l` | `2^l` |
| Max nodes of height `h` | `2^(h+1) - 1` |
| Min height for `N` nodes | `⌊log₂N⌋` |
| Min levels for `L` leaves | `⌊log₂L⌋` |
| Leaf nodes in full BT | `L = T + 1` |
| Edges in binary tree | `n - 1` |
