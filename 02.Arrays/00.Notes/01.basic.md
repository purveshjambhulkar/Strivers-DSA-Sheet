# 📘 C++ Arrays and Vectors - Detailed Notes

---

## 📌 1. **Array in C++**

### 🧠 *What is an Array?*
- An **array** is a *fixed-size* collection of elements of the **same data type**.
- Stored **contiguously** in memory.
- Size must be known at **compile time** (for static arrays).

### ✅ Features
- Fixed size.
- Fast random access (O(1) time for indexing).
- Cannot be resized dynamically.
- No bounds checking (accessing `arr[100]` is undefined behavior if `n < 100`).

### 🛠 Syntax

```cpp
int arr[5]; // declaration of integer array of size 5
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // initialization
arr[0] = 10; // access/update
```

### 💡 Common Pitfalls
- Going out of bounds is **undefined behavior**.
- Arrays passed to functions are **decayed into pointers** (`int arr[]` → `int* arr`).

## 📌 2. **Vector in C++**

### 🧠 *What is a Vector?*
- A **vector** is a **dynamic array** from the Standard Template Library (`<vector>`).
- Can grow/shrink in size.
- Safer and more flexible than arrays.

### ✅ Features
- **Dynamic resizing** (using heap internally).
- **Bounds-checked access** with `.at(index)`.
- STL methods: `.push_back()`, `.pop_back()`, `.size()`, `.clear()`, etc.
- Supports iterators, `for-each` loops.

### 🛠 Syntax

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> v;             // empty vector
vector<int> v(5);          // vector of size 5 with default values (0)
vector<int> v(5, -1);      // vector of size 5 initialized with -1
vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3}; // initializer list

v.push_back(10);           // add element at end
v.pop_back();              // remove last element
v.size();                  // returns current size
v[0] = 42;                 // access element
```

## 🔁 Traversal Methods

```cpp
// Method 1 - Index based
for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
    cout << v[i] << " ";
}

// Method 2 - Range-based for loop
for (int x : v) {
    cout << x << " ";
}

// Method 3 - Using iterator
for (vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
    cout << *it << " ";
}
```

## 📏 Differences: Array vs Vector

| Feature              | Array                      | Vector                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Size                 | Fixed at compile time      | Dynamic (can resize at runtime)|
| Memory Allocation    | Stack                      | Heap                           |
| Bounds Checking      | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes (via `.at()`)           |
| STL Support          | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes                         |
| Performance          | Slightly faster            | Slightly slower due to overhead|
| Resize Operations    | ❌ No                      | ✅ push_back, resize, etc.     |
| Initialization       | Simple                     | Rich and flexible              |

## 🚀 Best Practices

- Prefer **vectors** for most use-cases unless you *need performance optimization* and know array size in advance.
- Use `.at()` for safety in vectors if you want to avoid invalid access.
- When passing arrays to functions, remember they decay into pointers, so pass size as well.
- Reserve capacity in vectors if you know final size using `.reserve()` to improve performance.

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1 - Passing Vector to Function

```cpp
void printVector(const vector<int>& v) {
    for (int x : v) cout << x << " ";
}
```

### Example 2 - 2D Vectors

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> matrix(3, vector<int>(4, 0)); // 3x4 matrix filled with 0
```

### Example 3 - Sorting Vector

```cpp
vector<int> v = {4, 1, 3, 2};
sort(v.begin(), v.end()); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

| Flexibility  | ❌                | ✅                         |
| Safety       | ❌ No bound checks | ✅ .at() with bound checks |
