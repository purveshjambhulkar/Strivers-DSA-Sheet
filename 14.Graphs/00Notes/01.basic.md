# 📘 Graph and Its Types – Detailed Notes

## What is Graph Data Structure?

A **graph** is a non-linear data structure consisting of a set of **vertices** (also known as nodes) and **edges** (connections between the nodes). It is denoted as:

> **G(V, E)**  
> where:  
> `V` = set of vertices  
> `E` = set of edges

### Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a football game:
- **Players** = Nodes  
- **Passes or interactions** between them = Edges

This web of interactions is a practical example of a graph structure.

## Components of Graph Data Structure

### 🔸 Vertices (or Nodes)
- Basic units of a graph.
- Can be **labeled** or **unlabeled** depending on the context.
- Represent entities like players, people, cities, etc.

### 🔸 Edges (or Links)
- Represent connections or relationships between two vertices.
- Can be **directed** (having direction) or **undirected**.
- Can be **weighted** (e.g., distance, time, cost) or **unweighted**.

# 📘 Types of Graphs in Data Structure and Algorithms

## 1. Null Graph
- A **null graph** is a graph with **no edges** at all.
- It may contain one or more vertices, but **none of them are connected**.

# 📘 Graph Representation in Data Structures (with C++ Code)

Graphs can be stored using different representations based on problem constraints. The two most widely used methods are:

---

## 1. **Adjacency Matrix**

### TLDR:
Use a 2D matrix of size `V x V` where each entry `(i, j)` indicates if there’s an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.

### 💡 Key Observations:
- Fast edge lookups: O(1)
- Memory inefficient for sparse graphs
- Suitable for dense graphs or when graph is small

### ✅ Complexity:
- Space: O(V²)
- Edge insertion: O(1)
- Edge check: O(1)

### 🧠 Example:
For a graph with 4 vertices and edges: 0-1, 0-2, 1-2

### 📌 Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int V = 4; // number of vertices
    int adj[4][4] = {0}; // initialize matrix with 0

    // Add edges (undirected)
    adj[0][1] = 1;
    adj[1][0] = 1;

    adj[0][2] = 1;
    adj[2][0] = 1;

    adj[1][2] = 1;
    adj[2][1] = 1;

    // Print the adjacency matrix
    for(int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < V; j++) {
            cout << adj[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

> ![Adjacency Matrix](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240502183320/adjacency_mat1-(1)-copy.webp)

---

## 2. **Adjacency List**

### TLDR:
Use an array of lists where each index represents a vertex, and the list at that index stores the neighbors.

### 💡 Key Observations:
- Efficient for sparse graphs
- Slower edge lookups compared to matrix
- Saves memory for large graphs

### ✅ Complexity:
- Space: O(V + E)
- Edge insertion: O(1)
- Edge check: O(degree)

### 🧠 Example:
Same graph: 0-1, 0-2, 1-2

### 📌 Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int V = 4;
    vector<int> adj[4]; // array of vectors

    // Add edges (undirected)
    adj[0].push_back(1);
    adj[1].push_back(0);

    adj[0].push_back(2);
    adj[2].push_back(0);

    adj[1].push_back(2);
    adj[2].push_back(1);

    // Print adjacency list
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        cout << i << ": ";
        for (int j : adj[i]) {
            cout << j << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

# 📘 Basic Properties of a Graph

Graphs are powerful structures that model pairwise relationships between objects. They consist of a set of **vertices** (also called nodes) and **edges** (connections between vertices). Here are the fundamental properties that describe and distinguish graphs:

---

## 🔹 1. **Vertices (Nodes)**

- These are the individual entities in a graph.
- Each vertex may represent an object, like a city, a person, or a device.
- Example: In a social network graph, each person is a vertex.

---

## 🔹 2. **Edges**

- Edges are the connections or links between vertices.
- They may be:
  - **Undirected**: No specific direction (e.g., friendship).
  - **Directed**: Having direction (e.g., follower relationship on Twitter).

---

## 🔹 3. **Weight**

- A numeric value assigned to an edge, usually representing cost, distance, or time.
- A **weighted graph** includes these edge weights.
- Unweighted graphs have edges with no weight or implicit weight = 1.

> Example: In a roadmap, the edge weight could represent distance in kilometers.

---

## 🔹 4. **Degree of a Vertex**

- **Degree**: Total number of edges connected to a vertex.
- **In-degree**: Number of edges coming into a vertex (for directed graphs).
- **Out-degree**: Number of edges going out from a vertex (for directed graphs).

> Example: In a directed graph:
> - Vertex A → B, A → C
> - In-degree(A) = 0, Out-degree(A) = 2

---

## 🔹 5. **Path**

- A sequence of edges connecting a sequence of vertices.
- **Simple Path**: No repeated vertices or edges.
- Paths are used to determine reachability and shortest routes.

---

## 🔹 6. **Cycle**

- A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- **Simple Cycle**: No repeated vertices or edges (except the start/end).
- Cycles are important for detecting infinite loops, deadlocks, and circular dependencies.

> Example: A → B → C → A is a cycle.

---

## 🔹 7. **Connectedness**

- A **connected graph** is one in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.
- A **disconnected graph** has at least two components that are isolated.
- In directed graphs:
  - **Strongly Connected**: Path exists between all pairs of vertices in **both directions**.
  - **Weakly Connected**: Path exists **if direction is ignored**.

---

## 🔹 8. **Planarity**

- A **planar graph** can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.
- Example: A triangle or square graph is planar.
- Kuratowski’s Theorem helps determine planarity for complex graphs.

---

## 🔹 9. **Bipartiteness**

- A graph is **bipartite** if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that:
  - Every edge connects a vertex from U to one from V.
  - No edge connects vertices within the same set.
- Useful in modeling relationships between two types of entities (e.g., jobs and people, students and courses).

---

## 📝 Summary Table

| Property       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Vertex         | Entity in the graph |
| Edge           | Connection between two vertices |
| Weight         | Cost/distance assigned to edges |
| Degree         | Number of edges at a vertex |
| Path           | Sequence of connected vertices |
| Cycle          | Path starting and ending at same vertex |
| Connectedness  | Whether all nodes are reachable |
| Planarity      | Can graph be drawn without crossing |
| Bipartiteness  | Vertices divided in 2 sets with no intra-set edges |

# 📘 Applications, Advantages, and Disadvantages of Graph

Graphs are powerful non-linear data structures used to represent complex relationships among entities. They consist of **vertices (nodes)** and **edges (connections)**. A graph is defined as `G = {V, E}` where `V` is the set of vertices and `E` is the set of edges.

---

## 🔍 Graph Terminologies

- **Edge**: A connection between two nodes.
- **Adjacent Vertices**: Two vertices are adjacent if they are endpoints of the same edge.
- **Outgoing/Incoming Edges**: For directed graphs, edges have direction. Outgoing edges originate from a node; incoming edges point to a node.
- **Degree**: The number of edges connected to a vertex.
- **Source Vertex**: Vertex with in-degree 0.
- **Sink Vertex**: Vertex with out-degree 0.
- **Path**: Sequence of connected vertices and edges.
- **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- **Simple Path**: Path with all unique vertices.
- **Spanning Tree**: A subgraph that includes all vertices and is a tree.
- **Connected Component**: The most connected subgraph in a disconnected graph.
- **Bridge**: An edge which, if removed, increases the number of connected components.
- **Forest**: A graph with no cycles (i.e., collection of trees).

## 🛠️ Graph Representations

### 1. Set Representation
- **V = {V1, V2, V3, V4}**
- **E = {{V1, V2}, {V2, V3}, {V3, V4}, {V4, V1}}**
- Memory-efficient, but doesn’t support parallel edges.

### 2. Sequential Representations

#### ✅ Adjacency Matrix
- 2D matrix of size `V × V`
- `a[i][j] = 1` if there's an edge from `V_i` to `V_j`, else `0`.

#### ✅ Incidence Matrix
- Matrix of size `V × E`
- `a[i][j] = 1` if vertex `i` is incident to edge `j`.

#### ✅ Path Matrix (Reachability Matrix)
- `P[i][j] = 1` if there's a path from `V_i` to `V_j`.

### 3. Linked Representation
- Uses **adjacency lists**.
- Each vertex has a list of all adjacent vertices.
- Memory-efficient and commonly used in practice.

# 🔁 Transpose of a Directed Graph

## 📘 Definition

The **Transpose** of a directed graph `G` is another directed graph on the **same set of vertices** but with **all the edges reversed**.

> If the original graph `G` contains an edge `(u → v)`, then the transposed graph `G^T` will contain the edge `(v → u)`.

This operation is commonly used in **graph algorithms** like **Kosaraju’s algorithm** for finding **strongly connected components**.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Vertices remain unchanged**
- **Every directed edge is reversed**
- Works **only on directed graphs**
- Used in algorithms that explore **connectivity** or **reverse reachability**

---

## 🖼️ Illustration

![Transpose Graph](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240226172716/Transpose-Graph.webp)

---

## 🧾 Input Format

Graph is represented as an **Adjacency List**.

```cpp
int V = 5; // number of vertices
vector<int> adj[V]; // original graph
```

---

## 🔄 Output Format

Return a new adjacency list representing the transposed graph.

```cpp
vector<int> transpose[V];
```

---

## 👣 Steps to Compute Transpose

1. Create an empty adjacency list for the transposed graph.
2. Traverse each vertex `u` of the original graph.
3. For every adjacent vertex `v` of `u` (i.e., edge `u → v`), insert edge `v → u` in the transposed graph.
4. Return the new adjacency list.

---

## 🧠 Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E)

Where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.

---

## ✅ C++ Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> transposeGraph(int V, vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
        vector<vector<int>> transpose(V);

        for (int u = 0; u < V; ++u) {
            for (int v : adj[u]) {
                transpose[v].push_back(u); // reverse the edge u -> v to v -> u
            }
        }

        return transpose;
    }
};
```

---

## 📦 Example

### Input:

Original Graph (Adjacency List):

```
0 → 1
1 → 2
2 → 3
3 → 0
```

### Output:

Transposed Graph (Adjacency List):

```
1 → 0
2 → 1
3 → 2
0 → 3
```

---

## 💡 Real World Analogy

Think of it like **reversing all roads** in a city map:
- If you could go from A to B originally,
- After transposing, you can now go from B to A.

---

## 📌 Applications

- **Kosaraju’s Algorithm** (for Strongly Connected Components)
- **Reverse Traversals** or **Backtracking Paths**
- **Reversing dependencies** in graphs (like task scheduling)

---

## 🔑 Key Differences

1. **Cycles**: Graphs *may* contain cycles; Trees **never** contain cycles.
2. **Connectivity**: Graphs can be **disconnected**; Trees are **always connected**.
3. **Hierarchy**: Trees are hierarchical (with a **root node**); Graphs are not necessarily hierarchical.
4. **Edge Count**: A tree with `n` nodes always has `n-1` edges. A graph can have any number.
5. **Traversal Simplicity**: Trees offer simpler traversal (no need to worry about cycles).
6. **Parent-Child Relationships**: Trees have a strict parent-child relationship; graphs allow arbitrary links.

## 📌 Use Cases

### Graph:
- Social media friend suggestions
- Road and air route networks
- Computer networks
- Web page links

### Tree:
- File and folder structures
- Company organizational hierarchy
- Abstract Syntax Trees in compilers
- Search trees (BST, AVL, etc.)

## 🧠 Summary

- **Every Tree is a Graph** but not every **Graph is a Tree**.
- Trees are more **structured and constrained**, which often makes them more efficient for certain types of hierarchical data.
- Graphs are more **flexible**, making them suitable for complex, interconnected data structures.
