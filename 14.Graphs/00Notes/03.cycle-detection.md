# Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph (BFS & DFS)

## TLDR
Traverse the graph in dfs or bfs ,mark current node as visited , then for the adj nodes of the current node , if the they are not visited and apply bfs or dfs on then ,but if they are visited then they must be the parent of the current node or else cycle exists

## Problem
Given an undirected graph, determine whether it contains a cycle. A cycle exists if we can visit the same node again without traversing the same edge immediately.

---

# Approach 1 - BFS Traversal with Parent Tracking

## TLDR
Use a BFS traversal while tracking the parent node of each visited node. If you visit an already visited neighbor that is *not* the parent, a cycle is detected.

## Key Observations
- Undirected graphs have bidirectional edges, so every edge is seen twice (u-v and v-u).
- To distinguish a legitimate backtracking from a cycle, track the parent of each node.
- A cycle occurs if a visited neighbor is found that is not the parent.

## Steps
1. Build the adjacency list from the edge list.
2. Maintain a `visited` array.
3. For every unvisited node, start BFS from it.
4. In BFS, push `{node, parent}` pairs into a queue.
5. For each node:
   - Visit all neighbors.
   - If a neighbor is unvisited, enqueue it with the current node as parent.
   - If a neighbor is visited and is not the parent, return true.
6. If no cycles are found in any component, return false.

## Example Walkthrough
Given edges:
```
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
```
- Starting BFS from node 0:
  - 0 → 1 (parent = 0)
  - 1 → 2 (parent = 1)
  - 2 → 0 → already visited and not parent → cycle detected.

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V) for visited array and queue

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isCycleUtil(int start, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& adj, std::vector<int>& visited) {
        std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> q;
        visited[start] = 1;
        q.push({start, -1});

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front().first;
            int parent = q.front().second;
            q.pop();

            for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = 1;
                    q.push({neighbor, node});
                } else if (neighbor != parent) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    bool isCycle(int V, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& edges) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> adj(V);
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u);
        }

        std::vector<int> visited(V, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                if (isCycleUtil(i, adj, visited)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

# Approach 2 - DFS Traversal with Parent Tracking

## TLDR
Use DFS. While visiting each node, if a visited neighbor is found that is not the parent, a cycle exists.

## Key Observations
- DFS naturally uses recursion, and you can track the parent node in recursive calls.
- A cycle is detected if a neighbor is visited and is not the parent.

## Steps
1. Build the adjacency list from the edge list.
2. Maintain a `visited` array.
3. For every unvisited node, start DFS from it.
4. In DFS:
   - Mark current node as visited.
   - Recur on all neighbors.
   - If neighbor is not parent and already visited → cycle.
5. If no cycles found, return false.

## Example Walkthrough
Given edges:
```
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
```
- Start DFS from 0:
  - 0 → 1 (parent = 0)
  - 1 → 2 (parent = 1)
  - 2 → 0 → visited and not parent → cycle

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V) for recursion stack and visited array

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    bool dfsUtil(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& adj, std::vector<int>& visited, int node, int parent) {
        visited[node] = 1;

        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                if (dfsUtil(adj, visited, neighbor, node)) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else if (neighbor != parent) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    bool isCycle(int V, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& edges) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> adj(V);
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
            adj[v].push_back(u);
        }

        std::vector<int> visited(V, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                if (dfsUtil(adj, visited, i, -1)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

# Cycle Detection in Directed Graph

Detecting cycles in **directed graphs** requires careful observation of the direction of edges. The two most common and efficient approaches are:

- **DFS with visited + pathVisited**
- **BFS using Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm)**

---

# Approach 1 - DFS Traversal Using `visited` and `pathVisited` Arrays

## TLDR
In DFS, track:
- If a node is **visited** at all (`visited[]`)
- If a node is in the **current DFS path** (`pathVisited[]`)

A cycle is detected when you visit a node that is already in the current path (i.e., `pathVisited[node] == 1`).

## Key Observations
- A node being visited again doesn't mean a cycle — unless it's in the current path of DFS.
- `visited[]` tells whether a node has been visited before.
- `pathVisited[]` tells whether the node is in the current DFS call stack.

## Steps
1. Build the adjacency list from the edges.
2. Maintain two arrays:
   - `visited[V]` to mark all visited nodes.
   - `pathVisited[V]` to track the recursion stack.
3. For every unvisited node, call DFS.
4. In DFS:
   - Mark `visited[node] = 1`, `pathVisited[node] = 1`
   - For each neighbor:
     - If unvisited → DFS on neighbor
     - If `pathVisited[neighbor] == 1` → cycle detected
   - After all neighbors, reset `pathVisited[node] = 0` (backtrack)
5. If no cycle is found, return false.

## Example Walkthrough
Graph:
```
0 → 1 → 2 → 3
     ↑     ↓
     ←←←←←←
```
- DFS from 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 (again, and in path) → cycle detected.

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V) for recursion stack, `visited`, and `pathVisited`

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
    bool dfs(vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<int> &visited, vector<int> &pathVisited, int node) {
        visited[node] = 1;
        pathVisited[node] = 1;

        for (auto n : adj[node]) {
            if (visited[n] == 0) {
                if (dfs(adj, visited, pathVisited, n) == true) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else if (pathVisited[n] == 1) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        pathVisited[node] = 0;
        return false;
    }

    bool isCyclic(int V, vector<vector<int>> &edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
        for (auto edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
        }

        vector<int> visited(V, 0);
        vector<int> pathVisited(V, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (visited[i] == 0) {
                if (dfs(adj, visited, pathVisited, i) == true) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

# Approach 2 - BFS Using Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm)

## TLDR
If the number of nodes in the final topological ordering is **less than `V`**, a cycle exists. A valid topological sort can only be formed if there is no cycle.

## Key Observations
- If there is a cycle, some nodes will **never** have indegree 0 (i.e., cannot be "started" without a dependency loop).
- The nodes stuck in the cycle will **never** be added to the topological order.
- So, if the `topo` array has fewer nodes than `V`, a cycle exists.

## Steps
1. Build adjacency list from edges.
2. Create and fill `indegree[]` for all nodes.
3. Push all nodes with `indegree == 0` into the queue.
4. While queue is not empty:
   - Pop node from queue, add it to `topo` array.
   - For all neighbors, reduce their indegree.
   - If any neighbor’s indegree becomes 0, push into queue.
5. At end, if `topo.size() < V` → cycle exists.

## Example Walkthrough
Graph:
```
0 → 1 → 2 → 0
```
- All nodes have indegree ≥ 1. No node has indegree 0.
- Queue stays empty → topo remains empty → cycle detected.

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V) for indegree, queue, and topo array

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
 public:
    bool isCyclic(int V, vector<vector<int>> &edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
        for (auto edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
        }

        vector<int> indegree(V, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            for (auto n : adj[i]) {
                indegree[n]++;
            }
        }

        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }

        vector<int> topo;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int temp = q.front();
            q.pop();
            topo.push_back(temp);

            for (auto n : adj[temp]) {
                indegree[n]--;
                if (indegree[n] == 0) {
                    q.push(n);
                }
            }
        }

        if (topo.size() == V) {
            return false;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
};
```
