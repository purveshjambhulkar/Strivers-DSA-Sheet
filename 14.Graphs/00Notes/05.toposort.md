# Topological Sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, vertex `u` comes before `v` in the ordering. This only applies to **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**.

# Approach 1 - DFS Based Topological Sort

## TLDR
Use **DFS** and a **stack** to maintain the topological order. Push the node to the stack **after visiting all its neighbors** (post-order).

## Key Observations
- In DFS, we visit children first before adding the node to the topological order.
- This ensures all dependencies (outgoing edges) of a node are added before the node itself.
- A stack naturally reverses this order and gives the topological sort when popped.

## Steps
1. Build adjacency list from the edge list.
2. Initialize a `visited[]` array.
3. Run DFS for each unvisited node:
   - Mark it as visited.
   - Recursively run DFS on its neighbors.
   - Push the node into a stack after all neighbors are visited.
4. Pop all elements from the stack to get the topological ordering.

## Example Walkthrough

For edges: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]`

DFS starts at `0`, goes to `1`, then `2`, then `3`. After visiting 3 → push to stack, then 2, then 1, then 0.

Final stack (reversed order): `[0, 1, 2, 3]`

## Complexity

- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V) for visited array and recursion stack

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
  
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<int> &visited, stack<int> &st, int node) {
        visited[node] = 1;
        
        for (auto n : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[n]) {
                dfs(adj, visited, st, n);
            }
        }
        
        st.push(node);
    }
  
    vector<int> topoSort(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
        for (auto edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
        }
        
        vector<int> visited(V, 0);
        stack<int> st;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(adj, visited, st, i);
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> topo;
        while (!st.empty()) {
            topo.push_back(st.top());
            st.pop();
        }
        
        return topo;
    }
};
```

# Approach 2 - Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS Based)

## TLDR
Count the **indegree** of every vertex. Start with all nodes with `indegree = 0`, and perform BFS. As you remove nodes from the queue, decrease the indegree of their neighbors.

## Key Observations
- Nodes with `indegree = 0` can be placed first in topological ordering.
- When a node is removed from the queue, it means its dependencies are resolved.
- If at the end, the topological sort does not contain all vertices → graph contains a cycle.

## Steps
1. Build adjacency list from the edge list.
2. Calculate `indegree[]` for all nodes.
3. Push all nodes with `indegree = 0` into a queue.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   - Pop a node and add it to the topological ordering.
   - Reduce the indegree of all its neighbors.
   - If a neighbor’s indegree becomes `0`, add it to the queue.
5. Return the topological ordering.

## Example Walkthrough

Edges: `[[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]`

- indegree[0]=0, indegree[1]=1, indegree[2]=1, indegree[3]=1
- Start with `0` → pop → reduce indegree of 1 → push 1, and so on.
- Final topological order: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`

## Complexity

- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V) for indegree array and queue

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> topoSort(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        
        vector<vector<int>> adj(V);
        for (auto edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);
        }
        
        vector<int> indegree(V, 0);
        queue<int> q;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            for (auto n : adj[i]) {
                indegree[n]++;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < indegree.size(); i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> topo;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int temp = q.front();
            q.pop();
            topo.push_back(temp);
            
            for (auto n : adj[temp]) {
                indegree[n]--;
                if (indegree[n] == 0) {
                    q.push(n);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return topo;
    }
};
```
