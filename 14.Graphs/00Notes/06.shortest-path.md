# Shortest path Algorithms

# 1)For only Directed Acylic Graphs

# Topological Sorting Based Shortest Path in a DAG

## TLDR - (tell in short - how to solve this approach)

We compute the shortest path from a source node (usually node 0) in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) by first performing a **topological sort** and then **relaxing edges** in that order. This guarantees that for every edge u → v, we process u before v, ensuring correct distance propagation.

---

## Key Observations

- **Topological order** ensures that all ancestors of a node are processed before the node itself.
- Works only on **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**.
- We don’t need a priority queue (like Dijkstra’s) because the DAG guarantees no cycles.
- Nodes unreachable from source will retain infinite distance (we convert that to `-1`).

---

## Steps

1. **Build Adjacency List** from the input edge list.
2. **Perform DFS** to get a **topological ordering** using a stack.
3. Initialize a `shortest` distance array of size `V` with `INT_MAX`. Set `shortest[0] = 0`.
4. While the stack is not empty:
   - Pop the top node.
   - For each of its neighbors:
     - If current path to neighbor is shorter, update it.
5. Replace `INT_MAX` in the result with `-1` to indicate unreachable nodes.

---

## Example Walkthrough

### Input:

```
V = 6
edges = {
  {0, 1, 2},
  {0, 4, 1},
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 2, 2},
  {2, 3, 6},
  {4, 5, 4},
  {5, 3, 1}
}
```

### Topological Sort (one possible):

0 → 4 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 3

### Distance Updates:

- `shortest[0] = 0`
- From 0 → 1 (2), 0 → 4 (1)
- From 4 → 2 (1+2=3), 4 → 5 (1+4=5)
- From 5 → 3 (5+1=6)
- From 1 → 2 (2+3=5) → already 3 so no update
- From 2 → 3 (3+6=9) → 6 already exists, so no update

### Final Output:

`[0, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5]`

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)`
  - DFS for topological sort takes `O(V + E)`
  - Relaxation step also takes `O(V + E)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)`
  - For adjacency list and visited array

# 2)Shortest path for both Directed & Undirected Graphs

# Dijksra's Algorithm

# Approach 1 - Using Priority Queue (Min Heap)

## TLDR - (tell in short - how to solve this approach)

Use a min-heap (priority queue) to always expand the node with the smallest known distance. Relax edges from that node and update the distances of its neighbors.

---

## Key Observations

- Dijkstra’s algorithm is suitable for graphs with non-negative weights.
- Using a priority queue ensures that we always pick the node with the least current distance.
- It is efficient and widely used in real-time shortest path problems (e.g., GPS).

---

## Steps

1. Build the adjacency list from the given edges.
2. Initialize distance array with `INT_MAX`, and set the source's distance to 0.
3. Push the source node into the priority queue.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   - Pop the node with the smallest distance.
   - For each neighbor, check if a shorter path is found via the current node.
   - If so, update the neighbor’s distance and push it into the queue.
5. Return the distance array.

---

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:**  
V = 3  
Edges = {{0, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 2}, {0, 2, 4}}  
Source = 0

**Processing:**

- Initial distances: [0, ∞, ∞]
- After visiting 0 → 1: [0, 1, ∞]
- After visiting 1 → 2: [0, 1, 3]
- 0 → 2 directly is 4 but we already have 3, so no update.

**Output:**  
[0, 1, 3]

---

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(E * log V)` — each edge might be added to the priority queue.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)` — adjacency list + distance array + priority queue

---

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> dijkstra(int V, vector<vector<int>> &edges, int src) {
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(V);
        for(auto edge : edges){
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int w = edge[2];
            adj[u].push_back({v, w});
            adj[v].push_back({u, w});
        }

        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;

        vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX);
        dist[src] = 0;
        pq.push({0, src});

        while(!pq.empty()) {
            int currDist = pq.top().first;
            int node = pq.top().second;
            pq.pop();

            for(auto n : adj[node]) {
                int adjNode = n.first;
                int edgeWeight = n.second;

                if(currDist + edgeWeight < dist[adjNode]) {
                    dist[adjNode] = currDist + edgeWeight;
                    pq.push({dist[adjNode], adjNode});
                }
            }
        }

        return dist;
    }
};
```

---

# Approach 2 - Using Set Data Structure

## TLDR - (tell in short - how to solve this approach)

Instead of a priority queue, use a set which maintains pairs of `{distance, node}` to simulate a min-heap. It allows efficient deletion and updating of keys.

---

## Key Observations

- Sets automatically keep elements in sorted order.
- By erasing the old distance before inserting the new one, we ensure uniqueness and prevent stale values.
- Useful for implementing Dijkstra’s when decrease-key operation is needed (which isn’t directly supported by priority queue).

---

## Steps

1. Build the adjacency list from edges.
2. Use a set to simulate a priority queue.
3. Initialize the distance array and insert the source node with distance 0.
4. While set is not empty:
   - Get the node with the smallest distance.
   - Relax its neighbors and update distances.
   - Insert updated distances into the set.
5. Return the final distances array.

---

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:**  
V = 4  
Edges = {{0, 1, 1}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 2}, {2, 3, 1}}  
Source = 0

**Steps:**

- Initial: [0, ∞, ∞, ∞]
- After 0: [0, 1, 4, ∞]
- After 1: [0, 1, 3, ∞]
- After 2: [0, 1, 3, 4]

**Output:**  
[0, 1, 3, 4]

---

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(V * log V + E * log V)` due to insert/delete in set (log V) for each edge.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)`

  public:
    vector<int> dijkstra(int V, vector<vector<int>> &edges, int src) {

        for(auto edge : edges){
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int w = edge[2];

        vector<int> dist(V , INT_MAX);
        set.insert({0 , src});
        dist[src] = 0;

        while(set.size() != 0){
            pair<int ,int> temp = *set.begin();
            int node = temp.second;
            int d = temp.first;
            set.erase(set.begin());

            for(auto n : adj[node]){
                int adjNode = n.first;
                int adjDist = n.second;

                if(d + adjDist < dist[adjNode]) {
                    // Erase previous record if exists
                    if(dist[adjNode] != INT_MAX) {
                        set.erase({dist[adjNode], adjNode});
                    }
                    dist[adjNode] = d + adjDist;
                    set.insert({dist[adjNode] , adjNode});
                }
            }
        }

        return dist;
    }
};

# 3)Question where you have to return the entire path (shortest)

# Approach 1 - Dijkstra's Algorithm with Path Reconstruction

## TLDR - (tell in short - how to solve this approach)

Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to node `n`. Track parent nodes during updates to reconstruct the path once the shortest distance is computed.

---

## Key Observations

- Dijkstra’s algorithm is optimal for finding the shortest path in graphs with **non-negative weights**.
- Tracking the parent of each node allows us to **reconstruct the actual shortest path**.
- If the destination node remains at `INT_MAX` distance, it means it's **unreachable**.

---

## Steps

1. **Build the adjacency list** from the input edge list.
2. **Initialize**:
   - `dist[]` array with `INT_MAX`, set `dist[1] = 0`.
   - `parent[]` such that `parent[i] = i`.
   - Min-heap priority queue to process nodes by shortest known distance.
3. **Run Dijkstra's algorithm**:
   - Pop node with minimum distance.
   - Relax all adjacent edges.
   - If a shorter path is found to an adjacent node, update `dist` and `parent`.
4. **Check if destination (`n`) is reachable**:
   - If `dist[n] == INT_MAX`, return `{-1}`.
5. **Reconstruct the path** using the `parent[]` array.
6. **Return** the path prefixed with the shortest distance as the first element.

---

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:**

```
n = 5, m = 6
edges = {
  {1, 2, 2},
  {1, 3, 4},
  {2, 3, 1},
  {2, 4, 7},
  {3, 5, 3},
  {4, 5, 1}
}
```

**Processing:**

- Dijkstra finds shortest distances:  
  dist[1] = 0  
  dist[2] = 2  
  dist[3] = 3  
  dist[5] = 6  
  dist[4] = 7
- Path to node 5 is: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5
- Total cost: 6

**Output:**  
`[6, 1, 2, 3, 5]`

---

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(E * log V)`  
  Each edge can be relaxed once, and insertion/removal from priority queue takes log time.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)`  
  For the adjacency list, distance array, parent array, and priority queue.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> shortestPath(int n, int m, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {

        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int w = edge[2];

            adj[v].push_back({u, w});
        }

        vector<int> dist(n + 1, INT_MAX);
        vector<int> parent(n + 1);

                int adjNode = nbr.first;
                int wt = nbr.second;

                if (d + wt < dist[adjNode]) {
                    dist[adjNode] = d + wt;
                    parent[adjNode] = node;
                    pq.push({dist[adjNode], adjNode});
                }

            path.push_back(curr);
            curr = parent[curr];
        }
        path.push_back(1);
        reverse(path.begin(), path.end());

        vector<int> result;

# 4)Now Algorithms which can also handle -ve weight cycles

## Bellman Ford Algorithm

# Approach 1 - Bellman-Ford Algorithm

## TLDR - (tell in short - how to solve this approach)

Run a loop `V-1` times to relax all edges, updating shortest paths from the source. Then run one more iteration to check if any relaxation is still possible — if so, a negative weight cycle exists.

---

## Key Observations

- Bellman-Ford can handle **graphs with negative weight edges**.
- If after **V-1 iterations**, further relaxation is possible, it indicates a **negative weight cycle**.
- Each iteration relaxes all edges, possibly reducing the shortest path estimates.
- A graph without negative cycles is guaranteed to converge within `V-1` iterations because the longest path without a cycle has at most `V-1` edges.

---

## Steps

1. **Initialize**:

   - `dist[]` array with large values (`1e8` used as infinity placeholder).
   - Set `dist[src] = 0` since the source's distance to itself is zero.

2. **Relaxation**:

   - Repeat `V-1` times:
     - For every edge `(u, v, w)`, update `dist[v]` if `dist[u] + w < dist[v]`.

3. **Negative Cycle Check**:

   - Loop through all edges once more.
   - If any edge can still be relaxed, return `{-1}` indicating a negative weight cycle.

4. **Return** the `dist[]` array if no cycle was detected.

---

## Why `V - 1` Iterations Only?

> In a graph with `V` vertices, the longest path without repeating any vertices can have at most `V - 1` edges.  
> Hence, the shortest paths to all vertices must be finalized within `V - 1` iterations of edge relaxation if no negative cycles exist.

---

## How It Handles Negative Weight Cycles?

> Bellman-Ford performs one **extra (V-th)** iteration after the main loop.  
> If any edge can still be relaxed in this iteration, it implies the presence of a **negative weight cycle**, since the shortest path keeps decreasing — which is only possible due to a cycle with total negative weight.

- If such a condition is detected, the algorithm returns `{-1}`.

---

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:**

```
V = 5, src = 0
edges = {
  {0, 1, 5},
  {1, 2, -2},
  {2, 4, 3},
  {0, 3, 10},
  {3, 4, 1}
}
```

**Iterations:**

- After 1st iteration: dist = `[0, 5, INF, 10, INF]`
- After 2nd iteration: dist = `[0, 5, 3, 10, INF]`
- After 3rd iteration: dist = `[0, 5, 3, 10, 6]`
- 4th iteration brings no changes
- 5th iteration (for cycle check) brings no changes

**Output:** `[0, 5, 3, 10, 6]`

---

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(V * E)`  
  Every edge is checked `V-1` times + 1 additional check = `V * E` operations.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(V)`  
  For the `dist[]` array.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> bellmanFord(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int src) {
        vector<int> dist(V, 1e8);
        dist[src] = 0;

        // V - 1 iterations
        for(int i = 0 ; i < V - 1 ; i++) {

                int u = edge[0];
                int v = edge[1];

                if(dist[u] != 1e8 && dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                }

        }

            }
        }

# Floyd Warshall's Algorithm

# Approach 1 - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

## TLDR - (tell in short - how to solve this approach)

Floyd-Warshall is a dynamic programming algorithm used to compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It works for both directed and undirected graphs, and can handle negative weights (but not negative cycles). It updates the distance matrix in-place.

---

## Key Observations

- The algorithm tries to improve the shortest path from `i` to `j` using an intermediate node `k`.
- If `dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]`, then the shorter path goes through `k`.
- Requires `O(n^3)` time, but it works even with negative edge weights (as long as there are no negative cycles).
- We must check if `dist[i][k]` and `dist[k][j]` are not infinity (`1e8`) to avoid integer overflow.

---

## Steps

1. Initialize the `dist[i][j]` matrix based on input:
   - `dist[i][j] = weight` if edge exists.
   - `dist[i][j] = 0` if `i == j`.
   - `dist[i][j] = 1e8` if no direct edge.
2. For each intermediate node `k` from 0 to `n-1`, update all pairs `(i, j)`:
   - If both `dist[i][k]` and `dist[k][j]` are not infinity:
     - `dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])`
3. The matrix now contains the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.

---

## Example Walkthrough

Given:
```
dist = {
  {0, 5, 1e8},
  {1e8, 0, 3},
  {1e8, 1e8, 0}
}
```

- On using `k = 0`, check if any path from `i` to `j` can be improved using node 0.
- Repeat for `k = 1` and `k = 2`.

After the algorithm, the matrix will contain all-pairs shortest distances.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (in-place)
