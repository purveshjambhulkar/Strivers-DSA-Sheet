# üöÄ What is Breadth First Search (BFS)?

## üìò Definition

**Breadth First Search (BFS)** is a fundamental **graph traversal algorithm** used to explore vertices and edges of a graph in a systematic manner.

Unlike Depth First Search (DFS), **BFS explores the graph layer by layer**, starting from the source node and visiting all its neighbors before moving on to the neighbors‚Äô neighbors.

---

## üìà How It Works

BFS uses a **queue** to keep track of the nodes to be explored. It proceeds in the following way:

1. Start from the source node.
2. Visit all immediate neighbors (first level).
3. Move to the next level ‚Äî neighbors of the neighbors.
4. Repeat until all reachable nodes are visited.

---

## üîÅ BFS Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize** a queue and mark the starting node as visited.
2. **Enqueue** the starting node.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a node.
   - Visit and enqueue all **unvisited neighbors** of that node.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Characteristics

- **Traversal Order**: Level by level
- **Data Structure Used**: Queue (FIFO)
- **Visited Tracking**: Usually done via a `visited[]` array or set

## üí° Applications of BFS

| Application | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph** | BFS finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes |
| **Cycle Detection** | Useful for both undirected and directed graphs |
| **Connectivity Check** | Determines if all vertices are reachable |
| **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm** | Topological sort of a Directed Acyclic Graph |
| **Minimum Spanning Tree** | A variation of BFS used in Prim‚Äôs Algorithm |
| **Solving puzzles/mazes** | BFS finds the shortest path to the goal |
| **Web Crawlers** | Crawls level by level from a seed URL |

## üßÆ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`  
  Where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(V)`  
  Due to the visited array and queue used for traversal.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example Code (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

void bfs(int start, vector<int> adj[], vector<bool> &visited) {
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(start);
    visited[start] = true;

    while(!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        cout << node << " ";

        for(int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if(!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int V = 5;
    vector<int> adj[V];

    // Example graph (undirected)
    adj[0] = {1, 2};
    adj[1] = {0, 3, 4};
    adj[2] = {0};
    adj[3] = {1};
    adj[4] = {1};

    vector<bool> visited(V, false);
    bfs(0, adj, visited); // Start BFS from node 0

    return 0;
}
```

## üéØ Summary

- BFS is a **level-order traversal** for graphs.
- Uses a **queue** and a **visited structure**.
- Essential for **shortest path**, **cycle detection**, **topological sorting**, and many other graph problems.
- Forms the basis of many **popular algorithms** like Dijkstra, Prim, and Kahn‚Äôs.

# üîç Depth First Search (DFS) for a Graph

## üìò Definition

**Depth First Search (DFS)** is a fundamental **graph traversal algorithm** that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS dives deep into each path before moving to the next sibling node. It is analogous to **preorder traversal in trees**.

DFS is especially important in solving problems like **cycle detection, topological sorting, strongly connected components**, and many more.

---

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Graph Traversal**: Visit every vertex in a graph.
- **Visited Array**: To keep track of visited nodes and avoid infinite loops due to cycles.
- **Recursive/Iterative**: DFS can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack.
- **Backtracking**: DFS uses backtracking to explore all possible paths.

---

## üí° Use-Cases of DFS

| Use-Case                    | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Cycle Detection**        | Detects cycles in directed and undirected graphs. |
| **Connected Components**   | Identifies separate islands (components) in a graph. |
| **Topological Sorting**    | Works on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). |
| **Solving Mazes/Puzzles**  | DFS helps backtrack and try multiple paths. |
| **Path Finding**           | Useful when we need to explore all possible paths. |
| **Strongly Connected Components** | Used in algorithms like Kosaraju‚Äôs and Tarjan‚Äôs. |

---

## üîÅ DFS Traversal Steps

1. Start from any source vertex.
2. Mark the current node as visited.
3. Recur for all **unvisited adjacent vertices**.
4. Backtrack when no unvisited neighbors are found.

---

## üßÆ Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`  
  Where `V` is the number of vertices, and `E` is the number of edges.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  - Recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the graph: `O(V)` worst case.
  - Visited array: `O(V)`

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example Code (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void dfs(int node, vector<int> adj[], vector<bool> &visited) {
    visited[node] = true;
    cout << node << " ";

    for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            dfs(neighbor, adj, visited);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int V = 5;
    vector<int> adj[V];

    // Example graph (undirected)
    adj[0] = {1, 2};
    adj[1] = {0, 3, 4};
    adj[2] = {0};
    adj[3] = {1};
    adj[4] = {1};

    vector<bool> visited(V, false);
    dfs(0, adj, visited);  // Start DFS from node 0

    return 0;
}
```

---

## üß† Summary

- DFS is a **depth-oriented graph traversal** technique.
- Excellent for problems involving **backtracking**, **discovery of components**, and **pathfinding**.
- DFS can be implemented **recursively or iteratively using a stack**.
- Must always **track visited nodes** to avoid cycles or infinite loops.

## üîÅ Conceptual Differences

- **BFS** is like exploring one circle at a time around the start node.
- **DFS** is like going as deep as possible into one path before trying others.

---

## üß† Example Scenario

Imagine a maze:

- **BFS** would explore all possible directions step-by-step, layer-by-layer, ensuring the shortest exit is found.
- **DFS** would take one path until it hits a wall, then backtrack to try a new path, potentially not finding the shortest way.
