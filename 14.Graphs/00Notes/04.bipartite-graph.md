# Checking if a Graph is Bipartite using DFS

## TLDR
We use **DFS** to try and color each node using two colors (`0` and `1`). If any two adjacent nodes have the same color, the graph is **not bipartite**.

## What is a Bipartite Graph?

A **bipartite graph** is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets **U** and **V** such that every edge connects a vertex in **U** to one in **V**.  
That is, no two vertices in the same set are adjacent.

Formally:
- The graph can be colored with **two colors** such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
- Equivalently, a graph is bipartite if and only if it has **no odd-length cycle**.

## Key Observations
- A 2-colorable graph is bipartite.
- If during traversal, a node is visited and has the **same color as its neighbor**, then the graph is not bipartite.
- Disconnected components must also be handled (run DFS for every unvisited node).

## Steps
1. Initialize a `color[]` array of size `V` with all values as `-1` (uncolored).
2. Traverse each node from `0` to `V-1`.
   - If a node is uncolored, start DFS from it with initial color `0`.
3. In DFS:
   - Color the current node.
   - Traverse all neighbors.
     - If the neighbor is uncolored → DFS with the **opposite color**.
     - If the neighbor is already colored with the **same color** → not bipartite.
4. If no such conflict is found, return true.

## Example Walkthrough

Graph:
```
0 --- 1
|     |
3 --- 2
```

- Start from node 0 → color it `0`
- Neighbor 1 → color it `1`
- Neighbor 3 → color it `1`
- Node 1's neighbor 2 → color it `0`
- Node 2's neighbor 3 → already colored `1`, OK
- No violations found → graph is bipartite

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)  
  (Every node and edge is visited once)
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the `color[]` array and recursion stack

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:

    bool dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int> &color, int col, int node) {
        color[node] = col;

        for (int n : graph[node]) {
            if (color[n] == -1) {
                if (dfs(graph, color, 1 - col, n) == false) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else if (color[n] == col) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<int> color(graph.size(), -1);

        for (int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++) {
            if (color[i] == -1) {
                if (dfs(graph, color, 0, i) == false) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
